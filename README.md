# flutter-experiments

Modus Create is investing a lot of energy in Flutter. We're working to learn more about this ecosystem to help the community and our clients to build better hybrid apps.

This repository holds examples of different practices using Flutter. We are constatly publishing content in our [Blog](https://moduscreate.com/blog) and [Youtube Channel](https://www.youtube.com/moduscreate) about the experiments we've built here.

If you are a Modus Create employee and you want to contribute, feel free to join our #flutter-enthusiasts channel and start a discussion there.
